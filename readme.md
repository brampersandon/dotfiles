# What the heck is in here?

Desktop manager stuff, text editor configs (hi Vim, spacemacs, etc.), a zsh theme, if I'm lucky, the list of global NPM vars I installed, silly crap like that.

map:

```
Root
+++ config.sh
 |  a silly script I wrote to make it easier for all this stuff to go in the place I want it to go.
+++ .i3/
 |  +++ config
 |   |  i3dm config file
+++  .i3status
 |   configuring the status bar, for kicks and giggles
+++  /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/taptoclick.conf
 |   this one is fun: make sure my chromebook's trackpad doesn't suck.
+++ .spacemacs
 |   spacemacs config file (must have spacemacs in .emacs.d for this to be useful)
+++  .vimrc
 |    same.
+++  .Xsession
 |   set backlighty funness and xfluxy stuff
+++  .Xmodmap
 |   make things more OSX-y
+++  post-receive
 |   github hook for new repositories on the server
```
