# What the heck is in here?

In short: random stuff that makes a linux or macOS machine usable for me.

- `Xmodmap`: (linux specific) -- makes Cmd and Control behave more like macOS
- `Xsession`: (linux specific) -- triggers Flux automatically (not in use)
- `i3` and `i3status.conf`: i3wm configuration (in use on the rooted Chromebook)
- `bashrc` and `profile`: I really oughta dedupe these at some point
- `vimrc`: vim and neovim configs. Mostly x-platform, but requires vim-plug
- `tmux.conf`: lorde help me.
